<ul>
<li><p>SRVjoy is a GUI console written with Nokia's <a href="http://www.qt.io">QT</a>, an open-source and cross-platform GUI library.</p></li>
<li>
<p>It also depends on the <a href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net">The Player Project</a>, such as <code>libplayerc++</code> header files.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Download the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/playerstage/files/Player/">latest Player files</a> and install them.</p></li>
<li><p>To install Stage follow the <a href="https://github.com/rtv/Stage/blob/master/INSTALL.txt">Stage Installation Instructions</a>.</p></li>

<a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h4>

<p>Since we wanted a GUI (graphical user interface) that would allow a human operator to drive the robot and take snapshot images from the camera as well as to be presented with a live-video feed that can, eventually, be integrated with SLAM capabilities – to be added to the <em>Stage</em> simulator in future projects. </p>

<p>SRVjoy can also control any other robot that has Player drivers and provides similar interfaces. For now, it only supports position2d and camera interfaces, and can connect to a robot through Player's default port number <code>6665</code> being served on the <code>localhost</code>. Thus, the operator can drive the robot around (controlling both linear and angular speeds), and take snapshot images from the robot's camera. A video feed – native to the console – has not been implemented, yet playercam can be used externally at the same time SRVjoy is running.</p>

<p>The navigation can be done through the console buttons in the GUI shown in the <strong><em>screenshot TODO</em></strong>, or by using some assigned keys in the keyboard (The numeric keypad is the preferred choice at the moment).
The SRVjoy console operates in the following way:</p>

<p>– All control buttons have icons that show their moving directions. By pressing a direction button, the robot moves in that direction for as long as the
button remains pressed.</p>

<p>– Speed (linear and angular) can be controlled with the
sliders.</p>

<p>– The camera button will take a snapshot of the current
camera view and save it as camera####.jpg in the root folder of the executing program.</p>

<p><em>NOTE:</em> There is some delay for snapshots (the obot has to focus first, and then shoot), and sometimes the order of pictures appears shifted.</p>

<p>– Numkeys also resemble the layout of the console buttons, so they can be use to control the robot in a similar manner.</p>
